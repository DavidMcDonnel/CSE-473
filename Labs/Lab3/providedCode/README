DhtServer.java contains a partial implementation of the DhtServer.
You will need to add DhtClient.

DhtPacket contains a partial implementation of a utility class that
is helpful for handling DHT packets.

Pair is a utility class for a generic pair of objects.

script0 is a bash script you can use for testing a single DhtServer.
you are encouraged to use it for your initial debugging.

script1 is a bash script you can use for testing multi-server
configurtations. Again, feel free to use it for debugging.

script2 is designed for use in ONL. When running in ONL, you may
sometimes find it necessary to abort a run of script2. The easiest
way to do this is to first type CTRL-Z to interrupt the running
script. This will display a message with the script's "job number'
in square brackets (often, you'll see it as [1]). To actually kill
the script, type

	kill %N

where N is the integer job number. Now, this will NOT kill any java programs
that are running on other onl servers you may be using. To kill these
as well, use the killit script, by typing

	./killit

You may get some warning messages, but you can ignore these.

When running in ONL, make a point to notice the traffic charts,
showing traffic moving between the routers. This is just an easy
way to see if the expected network activity is happening while the
script is running. If the traffic seems to stop prematurely,
it can indicate a problem with your code or with the testbed.
